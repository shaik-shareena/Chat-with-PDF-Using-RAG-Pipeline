# Chat-with-PDF-Using-RAG-Pipeline
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for interacting with semi-structured data in multiple PDFs. The system will extract, chunk, embed, and store data for efficient retrieval, answer user queries, and perform comparisons accurately using the selected LLM model for generating responses.
